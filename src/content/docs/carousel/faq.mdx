Welcome to the Frequently Asked Questions section. Here you can find quick answers about licensing, prerequisites, and technical resources.

## What is the license for the Carousel plugin?

The **Carousel** plugin is **Closed Source** and proprietary. **All rights are reserved by Berke 'Despical' Akçen.**

By using this plugin, you agree to the following mandatory **Terms of Service**, which may be updated by the

## Which Java versions are supported?

The plugin is compiled using **Java Development Kit (JDK) 21**. Therefore, **Java 21 and newer versions** are
required to run the Easter Eggs plugin.

<Aside type="note">
    We always strive to adopt the latest stable Java version for optimal performance and security. We strongly
    recommend keeping your server updated, as future plugin updates may raise the minimum required Java version.

## Which Minecraft versions are supported?

We provide official support for Minecraft versions ranging from **1.8 up to 1.21.11**.

Maintaining compatibility with new versions is a core commitment; upcoming Minecraft versions will always be
supported promptly following their official release.

## Can I access the plugin's source code?

Yes, if you are a **legitimate customer** who has purchased the plugin, you can request access to the source
code repository.

To gain access, please follow these steps:
1.  Join our official [**Discord server**](https://discord.gg/uXVU8jmtpU).
2.  Open a **support ticket**.
3.  Provide **proof of purchase** (Transaction ID, receipt or Spigot username).
4.  Provide your **GitHub username**.

Once verified, you will be granted access to the private GitHub repository.

## What are the available sound names?

The plugin utilizes the **XSeries** library to ensure sound compatibility across different Minecraft versions (1.8 – 1.21+).
This means the sound names you use in your configuration files might differ from standard vanilla names.

The official list of all available and supported sound names can be found on the library's GitHub page:

[**List of All Available Sound Names**](https://github.com/CryptoMorin/XSeries/blob/master/core/src/main/java/com/cryptomorin/xseries/XSound.java#L69)

<Aside type="caution">
    While XSeries aims for wide support, you must verify that the chosen sound name exists within the specific Minecraft
    version your server is running (e.g., a sound added in 1.16 will not play on a 1.8 server).
</Aside>

## Why do my entities disappear randomly?

The plugin uses a unique, invisible identifier (tag) stored in the entity's custom name to track which horses belong to a carousel. This allows the plugin to clean up "ghost" entities that might get stuck after a restart.

**The internal tag used is:** `§8§8§0§c§d`

:::caution[Avoid using this tag]
If you manually give any entity a custom name containing this exact color code sequence (`§8§8§0§c§d`), the plugin will mistake it for a stuck carousel entity.

As a result, that entity will be **deleted automatically** when the server restarts or when you run the `/carousel purge` command.
:::

## Entities stuck after a reload or crash?

If your server crashes, shuts down unexpectedly, or if you reload while a carousel is spinning, you might notice "ghost" horses remaining in the world.

:::tip[Resolved in v1.8.9+]
This issue has been automatically resolved starting from version **1.8.9**. The plugin now intelligently detects and cleans up these stuck entities when the server starts up.
:::

However, if you still encounter stuck entities or want to manually clean them up without restarting, we have added a specific command for this:

```bash
/carousel purge
```
Running this command will instantly scan the worlds and remove any stuck carousel entities.
