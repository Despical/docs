This guide explains how to bring your world to life by creating interactive carousels and customizing them to fit your needs.

## 🎠 Creating a Carousel

To get started, you will need to spawn a carousel instance. The carousel will be created around your current location.

Run the following command in-game:

```bash
/carousel create <carousel_name>
```

:::tip[Good to Know]
Once you execute the command, the carousel will automatically start spinning around you. Players can ride any horse by simply right-clicking on them.

## 🛠️ Editing & Configuration

You can fully customize the appearance and interaction settings of your carousel using the built-in GUI Editor.

To open the editor menu, run:

```bash
/carousel edit <carousel_name>
```

### Editor Features

Inside the editor menu, you can tweak various settings to change how the carousel looks and functions:

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🐴 Horse Amount** | Adjust the number of horses in the carousel to change its density. |
| **👶 Baby Horses** | Toggle **Small Horses** mode to use baby variants instead of adults. |
| **🚫 Interaction** | Enable or disable **Riding** to prevent players from mounting the horses. |
| **🎒 Inventory** | Block players from opening the horse's inventory (saddle/armor slots). |
| **✨ Visual Effects** | Apply **Glowing Colors** to entities to make them stand out at night. |
| **🔗 Leash Settings** | Configure visual leash connections between the center and the entities. |
