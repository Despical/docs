description: Deep dive into the mechanics of carousel movement and how to fine-tune physics settings.

While the default settings work great for most servers, you might want to fine-tune exactly how your carousel moves. Whether you want a giant, slow-moving ferris wheel or a small, fast-spinning top, you can achieve it by modifying the **Behavior Settings**.

All settings below can be modified using the following command structure:

```bash
/carousel setting <id> <setting> <value>
```

## Movement & Speed

These settings control how frequently the carousel updates and how fast it spins.

### Ticks (Update Interval)
**Command:** `/carousel setting <id> ticks <value>`

This determines the delay (in Minecraft ticks) between each movement update.
* **Default:** `1` (Update every tick)
* **Concept:** Think of this as the **Refresh Rate** or **FPS** of your carousel.
* **Logic:** Minecraft runs at 20 ticks per second.
  * `1` = Super smooth movement (Updates 20 times/sec).
  * `5` = Choppier movement (Updates 4 times/sec).

<Aside type="tip">
    For the smoothest experience, keep this at **1**. Only increase this value if you have a massive carousel causing performance issues and you want to reduce CPU usage.

### Degree Increase (Rotation Speed)
**Command:** `/carousel setting <id> degreeIncrease <value>`

This controls the **Angular Velocity**. It defines how many degrees the horse moves around the center circle during each update (tick).
* **Higher Value:** The carousel spins **faster**.
* **Lower Value:** The carousel spins **slower**.

<Aside type="note">
    If you set this value too high (e.g., 90+), the horses might look like they are teleporting rather than spinning smoothly.

## Shape & Size

### Radius
**Command:** `/carousel setting <id> radius <value>`

This sets the distance (in blocks) from the center of the carousel to the horses.
* **Concept:** This effectively changes the **size** (width) of the carousel.
* Increasing the radius pushes the horses further away from the center block.

## Vertical Motion (Bobbing)

Real carousels don't just spin; horses go up and down! These two settings control that "wave" motion.

### Step Height
**Command:** `/carousel setting <id> stepHeight <value>`

This controls the **vertical speed** of the bobbing motion. It determines how much Y-level (height) is added or subtracted in every movement step.
* **Higher Value:** Horses move up and down very quickly (jerky motion).
* **Lower Value:** Horses move up and down slowly and gently.

### Max Height
**Command:** `/carousel setting <id> maxHeight <value>`

This controls the **amplitude** or **range** of the vertical movement. It sets the maximum number of blocks a horse can travel upwards from its starting point before it starts going back down.
* **Example:** If set to `1.0`, the horse will gently float up 1 block, then down 1 block.
* **Example:** If set to `5.0`, the horse will travel a significant distance up and down (like a roller coaster).

<Aside type="tip">
    **How they work together:**
    If you want a gentle motion, keep `Step Height` low (e.g., 0.1) and `Max Height` moderate (e.g., 1.0).
