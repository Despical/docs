This guide covers the main configuration files found in the plugin folder. You can tweak global settings in `config.yml` and translate or customize in-game text via `messages.yml`.

## ⚙️ Global Configuration

The `config.yml` file handles the core mechanics, optimization settings, and sound effects for the plugin.

```yaml title="config.yml"
# Leave the permission empty to allow every player to ride the horses.
riding-horse-permission: ""

# Should we check for updates when the plugin enables?
update-notifier: true

# Set 'NONE' to disable.
sounds:
  mount: NONE
  dismount: NONE
```

### Config Options Explained

Here is a detailed breakdown of each setting available in the configuration:

| Option | Type | Description |

## 💬 Localization

You can fully translate or customize all chat messages using the `messages.yml` file. This file supports standard color codes (e.g., `&a`, `&c`)
and HEX colors in the `<#RRGGBB>` format.

```yaml title="messages.yml"
commands:
  correct-usage: "&cCorrect usage: {0}"
  no-permission: "&cYou must be admin or higher to use this command!"
  did-you-mean: "&cDid you mean {0}?"
  already-created: "&cThere is already a created carousel named {0}!"
  created-carousel: "&aYou have successfully created a new carousel named {0}!"
