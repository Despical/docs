This page details every command available in the **Easter Eggs** plugin. While the primary command label is `/eastereggs`, you can also use the shorter aliases `/eggs` or `/egg` for convenience.

<Aside type="tip">
    For server administrators, granting the wildcard permission `eastereggs.*` will provide access to every command and feature listed on this page.
</Aside>

### Get Egg
Gives you the specified Easter Egg item to place in the world.
If you have created an egg with an ID that conflicts with a command name (e.g., an egg named "help" or "reload"),
you **must** use the `get` subcommand to retrieve it.

```bash
/eastereggs <egg id>
# OR
/eastereggs get <egg id>
```
* **Permission:** `eastereggs.get`

### Menu
Opens the interactive Easter Eggs GUI. This allows you to visually browse and take eggs.
You can provide an optional filter string to show only eggs that contain that specific text in their ID.

```bash
/eastereggs menu [id to filter]
```
* **Permission:** `eastereggs.menu`

### List
Displays a text-based list of all registered Easter Egg IDs in the chat.
This is useful for quickly checking available egg names without opening the GUI.

```bash
/eastereggs list
```
* **Permission:** `eastereggs.list`

### Copy
Copies the Easter Egg that you are currently looking at.
This is a builder utility; if you are looking at a placed egg, this command gives you that exact egg item in your inventory.

```bash
/eastereggs copy
```
* **Permission:** `eastereggs.copy`

### Texture
Updates the texture of the Easter Egg item you are currently holding.
The item in your hand must be a valid Easter Egg (player head). The new item will retain the properties of an egg but will visually change to the ID you specify.

```bash
/eastereggs texture <id of the new texture>
```
* **Permission:** `eastereggs.texture`

### Reset Statistics
Resets the collection progress. This command is flexible and works in three ways:
1.  **No arguments:** Resets **your own** stats.
2.  **Player name:** Resets **all** found eggs for that player.
3.  **Player + Egg ID:** Resets only the **specified egg** for that player.

```bash
/eastereggs resetstats [player] [egg id]
```
* **Permission:** `eastereggs.resetstats`

### Save Statistics
Manually saves all cached player data to your database.
While the plugin saves data automatically, this is useful before server maintenance. Use the `--silent` flag to run it without sending a message to the chat.

```bash
/eastereggs savestats [--silent]
```
* **Permission:** `eastereggs.savestats`

### Remove All
Permanently removes **every** placed instance of a specific Easter Egg ID from the world.
**Warning:** This will delete the blocks from the map and remove their locations from the database.

```bash
/eastereggs removeall <egg id>
```
* **Permission:** `eastereggs.removeall`

### Reload
Reloads all configuration files (`config.yml`, `messages.yml`, etc.) and refreshes the Easter Egg data. Use this to apply configuration changes
instantly without restarting the server.

```bash
/eastereggs reload
```
* **Permission:** `eastereggs.reload`

<Aside type="caution">
    Changes made to player statistics file (`data.yml`) will **not** be applied upon reload. This is because user data is cached internally
    for better performance and efficiency.
</Aside>

### Info
Displays detailed debugging information about the plugin, including the version, server software, and Java environment.

```bash
/eastereggs info
```
* **Permission:** `eastereggs.info`

### Help
Displays a comprehensive list of all available commands along with their descriptions.
You can hover over the commands in the chat to see more details.

```bash
/eastereggs help
```
* **Permission:** `eastereggs.help`

## Extra Permissions

These permissions are not tied to a specific command but control player interactions with the eggs.

**`eastereggs.break`**
* Allows the player to physically break and remove Easter Egg blocks placed in the world. By default, players cannot break eggs to prevent griefing.

**`eastereggs.tabcompleter`**
* Grants permission to use the tab-completion feature. When typing `/eastereggs`, the player will see a list of valid sub-commands and egg IDs.
