This guide provides an overview of all configuration and data files used by the **Easter Eggs** plugin.
Understanding this structure is crucial for server configuration and maintenance.

## File Hierarchy

The plugin generates the following files inside your `/plugins/EasterEggs` folder:

### 📁 Configurable Files

| File | Purpose | Reference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `config.yml` | Core settings, particle effects, sounds, and global commands. | Current Page [(Below)](/easter-eggs/configuration#global-settings-configyml) |
| `messages.yml` | All chat messages, GUI titles, and lore. | Current Page [(Below)](/easter-eggs/configuration#messaging-and-localization-messagesyml) |
| `mysql.yml` | **Database connection settings.** | [Database Configuration](/easter-eggs/database) |

### 🚫 Automatic Data Files

These files are managed automatically by the plugin. **Do not modify them manually.**

| File | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `data.yml` | Stores individual **player statistics** (collected eggs). |
| `locations.yml` | Stores the precise **location** of every placed Easter Egg in the world. |

<Aside type="caution">
    Manually editing `data.yml` or `locations.yml` can cause severe data loss, corruption, or console errors.
    Only edit files explicitly listed as configurable.
</Aside>

## Global Settings (`config.yml`)

These settings control the plugin's overall behavior and features.

| Attribute | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `mysql-enabled` | `false` | If `true`, the plugin uses MySQL for data storage and cross-server syncing. **Requires `mysql.yml` setup.** |
| `general-cooldown` | `0` | Time in seconds a player must wait between collecting *any* type of Easter Egg. (0 = no global cooldown) |
| `auto-data-saving` | `300` | Interval in seconds between automatic player data saves. (Set to `0` to disable auto-saving; data will only save on shutdown/reload). |
| `update-notifier` | `true` | If `true`, the plugin checks for new versions on startup. |

### Sensory Settings (Sounds, Particles, Fireworks)

These sections in `config.yml` control visual and auditory feedback. Refer to the [FAQ page](/easter-eggs/faq) for lists of available particle and sound names.

| Section | Key Attributes | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `particles` | `interval`, `distance-limit`, `disabled` | Global settings for particle density, visibility range, and overall toggling. |
| `sounds` | `new-egg-found`, `cooldown`, `all-eggs-found` | Configures the sound effects played for various player interactions. |
| `fireworks` | `enabled`, `color`, `type`, `power` | Controls whether a firework spawns when an egg is found, and defines its appearance. |
| `commands` | `found-all-the-eggs` | Commands executed by the console or player when a player successfully finds **all** eggs defined in the configuration. |

## Action Bar Configuration

The `action-bar` section controls the message displayed to players when they are near an uncollected Easter Egg.

| Attribute | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `enabled` | `true` | Toggles the action bar feature on or off. |
| `radius` | `9.5` | The block radius in which players will begin receiving the action bar message. |
| `interval` | `30` | How often (in ticks) the action bar message rotates or updates. (20 ticks = 1 second) |
| `sort` | `true` | If `true`, the plugin sorts nearby eggs so the message refers to the **closest** egg. |
| `only-not-found`| `true` | If `true`, the action bar only sends messages about eggs the player hasn't collected yet. |
| `permission` | `""` | The permission required to see the action bar. (Leave empty to allow all players). |
| `messages` | List | The list of messages that rotate in the action bar. Placeholders: `%player%`, `%egg_id%`. |

## Messaging and Localization (`messages.yml`)

This file contains all player-facing messages, GUI names, and item lore.

### Message Formatting
* **Hex Color Support:** The file supports modern color codes using the standard Hex format (`<#RRGGBB>`).
* **Disable Messages:** To prevent a message from being sent, set its value to `%do_not_send%`.

### Menu Configuration (`eggs-menu`)

This sub-section defines the specific items and text used within the main Easter Eggs GUI.

| Item/Section | Description | Notes |

| `close-item` | The item used to close the menu (`BARRIER`). | |
| `next-page` / `previous-page` | Items used for GUI pagination. | |
| `egg` | Defines the name and lore shown for each egg in the GUI. | Lore contains teleport/remove instructions for staff. |

### Placeholder Defaults (`placeholders` section)

This section defines the fallback strings used when specific placeholder states are queried.

| Placeholder String | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `persistent` | String returned when `%eastereggs_ID:persistent%` is `true`. |
| `not-persistent` | String returned when `%eastereggs_ID:persistent%` is `false`. |
