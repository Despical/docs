This guide explains how to add new Easter Eggs to your server configuration and place them in your world.

## Creating a New Easter Egg

Before you can place a custom egg in the game, you need to define it in the `config.yml` file. Locate the `easter-eggs` section to add your new entry.

Here is a minimal example of a new egg definition:

```yaml title="config.yml"
easter-eggs:
  # This ID (green_present) acts as the unique identifier.
  green_present:
    # The texture is the only REQUIRED field.
    texture: "eyJ0ZXh0dXJlcyI6eyJTS0lOIjp7InVybCI6Imh0dHA6Ly90ZXh0dXJlcy5taW5lY3JhZnQubmV0L3RleHR1cmUvZDA4Y2U3ZGViYTU2YjcyNmE4MzJiNjExMTVjYTE2MzM2MTM1OWMzMDQzNGY3ZDVlM2MzZmFhNmZlNDA1MiJ9fX0="
```

<Aside type="tip">
    You can find thousands of custom head textures on websites like [Minecraft-Heads](https://minecraft-heads.com).
    Simply copy the **Value** string found under the **"For Developers"** section of any head.

## Placing the Egg

Once your egg is defined in the configuration, follow these steps to add it to your world.

<Steps>

1.  **Get the Easter Egg Item**

    Run the following command in-game to receive the egg item. Replace `green_present` with the ID you defined in the config.

    ```bash
    /eggs green_present
    ```

2.  **Place the Egg**

    Place the egg anywhere in your world. It immediately becomes interactable and ready for players to collect.

3.  **Test It**

    Right-click the egg you just placed to verify it works.

    - 🎉 You should see particle effects.
    - 🔊 You should hear a sound.
    - 💬 You should receive a chat message confirming you found it.

</Steps>

## Configuration Attributes

You can customize every aspect of an egg, from the rewards to the visual effects. Below are the all available options for the `easter-eggs` section.

### 🖼️ Texture <Badge text="Required" variant="success" />

Defines the visual appearance of the block using a Base64 encoded string.

```yaml
texture: "BASE64_STRING_HERE"
```

### 💬 Messages <Badge text="Optional" variant="tip" />

You can override the default language messages for specific Easter Eggs.

| Attribute | Description | Internal Placeholders |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `new-egg-found` | Sent when a player collects this egg for the first time. | `{0}` found count, `{1}` total count |
| `egg-already-found` | Sent when a player interacts with an egg they have already collected. | `{0}` found count, `{1}` total count |
| `all-eggs-found` | Sent when collecting this egg completes the entire collection. | `{0}` found count, `{1}` total count |
| `has-blacklisted-perm` | Sent to players who are restricted from collecting this egg due to the blacklist. | None |
| `no-whitelisted-perm` | Sent to players who lack the required whitelisted permission to collect this egg. | None |

<Aside type="tip">
    **PlaceholderAPI Support**
    All message fields above fully support **PlaceholderAPI**.
    Even if a message lists "None" for internal placeholders, you can still use standard PAPI placeholders (e.g., `%player_name%`, `%server_online%`).
</Aside>

### 📜 Executing Commands <Badge text="Optional" variant="tip" />

You can define specific commands to be executed when players interact with an Easter Egg.

* **Console Commands:** By default, all commands are executed by the console.
* **Player Commands:** To make the player execute the command (e.g., for chat macros or GUI openers), prefix the command with `p:`

**Available Placeholders:**
* `%player%` - The name of the player interacting with the egg.
* `%egg_id%` - The ID of the specific egg.

#### Command Triggers

The following hooks are available to trigger commands based on the interaction result:

| Attribute | Trigger Condition |
| :--- | :--- |
| `new-egg-found` | Executed when a player successfully collects the egg for the **first time**. |
| `egg-already-found` | Executed when a player interacts with an egg they have **already collected**. |
| `all-eggs-found` | Executed when collecting **this specific egg** results in the player completing the entire collection. |
| `has-blacklisted-perm` | Executed when a player tries to collect the egg but is blocked by a **blacklisted permission**. |
| `no-whitelisted-perm` | Executed when a player tries to collect the egg but lacks the required **whitelisted permission**. |

#### Example Configuration

```yaml
commands:
  new-egg-found:
    - "give %player% diamond 1"        # Console gives a diamond to the player
    - "p:say I found a hidden egg!"    # Player says a message in chat

  egg-already-found:
    - "msg %player% &cYou already looted this prize!"

  all-eggs-found:
    - "broadcast &a&l%player% has found all the Easter Eggs!"
    - "crate give key legendary %player%"
```

### 🔒 Permissions <Badge text="Optional" variant="tip" />

Control exactly who can collect this specific egg.

* **Whitelist:** Only players with **at least one** of these permissions can collect the egg.
* **Blacklist:** Players with **any** of these permissions are blocked from collecting the egg.

```yaml
permissions:
  whitelist:
    - "eggs.collection.vip"
  blacklist: []
```

### ✨ Particles <Badge text="Optional" variant="tip" />

You can define ambient particle effects that spawn continuously around the Easter Egg to make it easier (or harder) to spot.

* **`not-found`**: The particle effect shown to players who have **not yet found** this egg. (Default: `VILLAGER_HAPPY`)
* **`found`**: The particle effect shown to players who have **already collected** this egg. (Default: `CRIT`)

Set any value to `NONE` to disable that specific state.

```yaml
particles:
  found: CRIT
  not-found: VILLAGER_HAPPY
```

<Aside type="note">
    Global settings (spawn rate, view distance, etc.) for these particles are configured under the `particles` section.

### ⏱️ Miscellaneous Settings <Badge text="Optional" variant="tip" />

Advanced settings for behavior control.

| Attribute | Default | Description                                                                                                         |

| `action-bar-disabled`| `false`| If `true`, hides action bar messages when the player is near an egg.                                                       |
| `remove-on-collect`| |                                                                      |
| └ `enabled` | `false` | If `true`, the block is replaced with the material specified in `convert-to` after being collected.                                                              |
| └ `convert-to` | `AIR` | The material to replace the egg with (e.g., `AIR`, `STONE`).                                                        |
