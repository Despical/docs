### Which Minecraft versions are supported?

Maintaining compatibility with new versions is a core commitment; upcoming Minecraft versions will always be
supported promptly following their official release.

### Can I access the plugin's source code?

Yes, if you are a **legitimate customer** who has purchased the plugin, you can request access to the source
code repository.

To gain access, please follow these steps:
1.  Join our official [**Discord server**](https://discord.gg/uXVU8jmtpU).
2.  Open a **support ticket**.
3.  Provide **proof of purchase** (Transaction ID, receipt or Spigot username).
4.  Provide your **GitHub username**.

Once verified, you will be granted access to the private GitHub repository.

### What are the available sound names?

The plugin utilizes the **XSeries** library to ensure sound compatibility across different Minecraft versions (1.8 – 1.21+).
This means the sound names you use in your configuration files might differ from standard vanilla names.

The official list of all available and supported sound names can be found on the library's GitHub page:

[**List of All Available Sound Names**](https://github.com/CryptoMorin/XSeries/blob/master/core/src/main/java/com/cryptomorin/xseries/XSound.java#L69)

<Aside type="caution">
    While XSeries aims for wide support, you must verify that the chosen sound name exists within the specific Minecraft
    version your server is running (e.g., a sound added in 1.16 will not play on a 1.8 server).
</Aside>

### What are the available particle effect names?

The plugin utilizes the Despical's **ParticleLib** library to manage and display all particle effects, ensuring high
customization and handling version differences.

You can find the official list of all available particle effect names that can be used in the configuration files here:

[**List of All Available Particle Effect Names**](https://github.com/Despical/ParticleLib/blob/master/src/main/java/me/despical/particle/ParticleEffect.java#L51)

<Aside type="caution">
    While the library aims for wide support, you must ensure that the specific effect you choose is supported by the
    Minecraft version your server is currently running. For instance, particles introduced in 1.13+ will not display on a 1.8 server.
