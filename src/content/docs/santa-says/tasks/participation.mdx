title: Participation Tasks
description: A complete list of participation-based tasks in Santa Says.
---

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Participation tasks are challenges where every player who successfully completes the objective is rewarded equally. Unlike competitive tasks, these focus on individual execution rather than being the "first" or "only" one to succeed.

<Aside type="tip">
    **Scoring:** Every player who successfully completes a participation task receives **1 point**.
</Aside>

## Configuration

Each participation task has its own configuration file for fine-tuning settings, messages, and specific task requirements.

<Aside type="note">
    You can find the configuration files for these tasks at:
    `plugins/SantaSays/tasks/participation/[task-name].yml`
</Aside>
