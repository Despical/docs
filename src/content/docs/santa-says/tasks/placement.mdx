title: Placement Tasks
description: A complete list of placement-based (competitive) tasks in Santa Says.
---

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Placement tasks are competitive challenges where speed or volume is key. Unlike participation tasks, only the top three players receive points, making these tasks the primary way to climb the leaderboard.

<Aside type="note">
    **Scoring Logic:**
    * **1st Place:** 3 Points
    * **2nd Place:** 2 Points
    * **3rd Place:** 1 Point
    * **Everyone else:** 0 Points
</Aside>

## Configuration

Each placement task has a dedicated configuration file to manage materials, amounts, and task-specific settings.

<Aside type="note">
    You can find the configuration files for these tasks at:
    `plugins/SantaSays/tasks/placement/[task-name].yml`
