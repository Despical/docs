title: Arena Setup Guide
description: A step-by-step guide to creating and configuring your first Santa Says arena.
---

import { Aside, Steps, Badge } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Setting up an arena in Santa Says is done through an intuitive in-game GUI. This guide will walk you through the process from the initial command to the final registration.

---

## Step 1: Create the Arena
To begin, you need to initialize a new arena instance. Each arena must have a **unique ID**.

```bash
/santasays create <arena_id>
```

<Aside type="caution">
    If the ID is already in use, you will receive an error message. Choose a name that is easy to remember (e.g., `winter_01`).
</Aside>

---

## Step 2: Open the Setup Menu
Once the arena is created, enter the Edit Mode to access the configuration GUI.

```bash
/santasays edit <arena_id>
```

This command opens the main setup menu where all configurations are handled.

---

## Step 3: Configure Game Locations
Click on the **Arena Locations** (`FILLED_MAP`) item in the main menu to set the teleportation points.

* **Lobby** (`COMPASS`): The location where players are teleported when they join the arena and wait for the game to start.
* **Start Location** (`CLOCK`): The specific point where players are teleported the moment the game loop begins.
* **End Location** (`END_PORTAL_FRAME`): The location where players are sent after the game ends or if they leave.

    You can use the **Go Back** (`REDSTONE`) item to return to the main setup menu at any time.
</Aside>

---

## Step 4: Set Player Amounts <Badge text="Optional" variant="tip" />
From the main menu, click on **Player Amounts** (`GLOWSTONE_DUST`) to define the arena's capacity.

* **Minimum Players**: How many players are needed to start the lobby countdown.
  * `LEFT CLICK` to increase | `RIGHT CLICK` to decrease.
* **Maximum Players**: The total capacity of the arena.
  * `LEFT CLICK` to increase | `RIGHT CLICK` to decrease.

---

## Step 5: Select the Game Platform
The **Platform Selector** (`BLAZE_ROD`) is used to define the area where the "Santa Says" tasks will take place. Clicking this will give you a **Selection Wand**.

### **Wand Controls**

The platform represents the playable area. **Important:** The platform must be **2D**, meaning it can only be **1 block high (Y-axis = 1)**. Use the Selection Wand to define this area:

#### **1. Area Selection (Cuboid)**
To add or remove large rectangular areas at once, you need to select two corners:
* **Left Click:** Selects Pos1 and Pos2. All blocks within the selected rectangle will be **ADDED** to the platform.
* **Right Click:** Selects Pos1 and Pos2. All blocks within the selected rectangle will be **REMOVED** from the platform (useful for carving out holes).

#### **2. Precision Selection (Single Block)**
If you need to fine-tune your platform block-by-block:
* **Sneak + Left Click:** **ADDS** the specific block you are looking at to the platform.
* **Sneak + Right Click:** **REMOVES** the specific block you are looking at from the platform.

<Aside type="caution">
    The platform is strictly a flat plane. Ensure all selected blocks are on the same height (Y-level) for the game to function correctly.
</Aside>

## Step 6: Create an Arena Sign <Badge text="Optional" variant="tip" />
Look directly at a sign and click the **Create Arena Sign** (`OAK_SIGN`) item. This will link the sign to your arena.

The sign will automatically update its status (Waiting, Starting, In-Game, Ending) and display the current player count.

---

## Step 7: Register the Arena
Once you have configured all locations, player amounts, and the platform, it’s time to finalize.

Click the **Register the Arena** (`FIREWORK`) item. The plugin will validate your settings and, if everything is correct, the arena will be activated and ready for players!

---

## Joining the Game
After successfully registering your arena, players can join the action in two ways:

    1. By Command: Use `/santasays join <arena_id>` to enter the lobby.

    2. By Sign: If you created an `Arena Sign in Step 6`, simply **Right-Click** the sign to join.
