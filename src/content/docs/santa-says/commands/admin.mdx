Admin Commands are designed for **server administrators and staff members** to manage Santa Says games, arenas, and plugin behavior.

All commands can be used via `/santasays` or its alias `/ss`. Unless otherwise stated, all commands can also be executed from the console.

---

## Main Command

Displays basic plugin information and provides access to the help menu.

When executed without arguments, the command shows the current Santa Says version and authors.
If the sender has administrative permissions, it also points to the help command.

```bash
/santasays
```

---

## Start Command

Administrators with the `santasays.admin.start` permission can use this command to bypass waiting timers and immediately begin a match.

This command allows you to force-start the match in the arena you are currently joined to by using it without arguments, or to start a specific arena remotely by providing its name. Note that a match cannot be started if there are no players currently joined to the arena.

```bash
/santasays start [arena]
```

---

## Stop Command

Administrators with the `santasays.admin.stop` permission can use this command to immediately terminate an ongoing match without waiting for its natural conclusion.

This command allows you to stop the match you are currently participating in by using it without arguments, or to shut down a specific arena remotely by providing its name.
Importantly, matches terminated via this command are considered cancelled, meaning player statistics and game progress will not be saved.

```bash
/santasays stop [arena]
```

---

## Help Command

Administrators with the `santasays.admin.help` permission can use this command to display a comprehensive list of available commands and their usage instructions.

This command provides an organized overview of the plugin's functionality. The help menu is dynamic; depending on the sender's specific permissions and whether debug mode is enabled in the configuration, it will automatically expand to include administrative and debugging commands.

```bash
/santasays help
```

---

## Reload Command

Essential for server administrators with the `santasays.admin.reload` permission to apply changes made to configuration files without requiring a server restart.

This command performs a comprehensive synchronization, updating the plugin's internal state. It reloads the messages, config options,
custom items, event profiler, boss bar and scoreboard contents.

```bash
/santasays reload
```

    For server administrators, granting the wildcard permission `santasays.admin.*` will provide access to every command listed on this page.
