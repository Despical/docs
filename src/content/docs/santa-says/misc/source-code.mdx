Santa Says is a closed-source project by default. However, we offer a **Source Code License** for server owners and developers who wish to modify, audit, or extend the plugin for their **private use**.

This is not just a raw code dump; it is a professionally architected software project written with scalability and performance in mind.

## Project Architecture

The codebase follows a modular design pattern, separating game logic, arena management, and tasks into distinct services. This makes adding new tasks or modifying game mechanics straightforward.
