import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The `GameEvent` class is an abstract base for all events associated with a specific, active game session. It provides developers with direct access to the `Game` instance and its various internal managers, making it the primary entry point for manipulating game logic.

<Aside type="note">
    As an abstract class, you cannot listen to `GameEvent` directly. You must listen to its subclasses, such as `GameStartEvent` or `GameStopEvent`.
</Aside>

## Accessible Game Managers
Through the `Game` object provided by this event, you can access several core managers to customize the game experience:

* **TaskManager:** Handles task selection and execution.
* **RoundManager:** Manages the lifecycle and progression of rounds.
* **VisibilityManager:** Controls player visibility rules (e.g., hiding players).
* **ScoreboardManager:** Updates and manages player scoreboards.
* **ScoreRegistry:** Stores and manages individual player scores.
* **BossBarManager:** Controls the boss bar displays for players in the game.

## Known Subclasses
Since `GameEvent` is the root for game lifecycle notifications, it is implemented by:
* **GameStartEvent**: Fired when a game officially begins.
* **GameStopEvent**: Fired when a game is stopped or finishes.
* **GameLoadEvent**: Fired when a game instance is initialized.

## Usage in Listeners

When listening to any game-related event, you can easily pull arena settings or check the current round progress.

```java
import io.greenmc.santasays.api.event.game.GameStartEvent;
import org.bukkit.event.EventHandler;
import org.bukkit.event.Listener;

public class GameStatusListener implements Listener {

    @EventHandler
    public void onGameEvent(GameStartEvent event) {
        // Access the arena name via the base GameEvent methods
        String arenaName = event.getArena().getName();

        // Access game managers
        int totalRounds = event.getGame().getRoundManager().getRound();

        System.out.println("Game event triggered in arena: " + arenaName);
    }
}
```
