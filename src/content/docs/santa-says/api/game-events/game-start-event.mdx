title: GameStartEvent
description: Documentation for the event fired when a game session has initialized and is ready to start.

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The `GameStartEvent` is triggered when a Santa Says game has finished all its internal setup and is about to begin. At this point, players have been teleported, their scores have been reset, and the tasks have been prepared.

<Aside type="note">
    The actual game loop (timers, task logic, and round processing) becomes active on the **next server tick** after this event is fired.

## Methods

This event inherits all utility methods from the base [`GameEvent`](/santa-says/api/game-events/game-event) class, allowing you to access the `Game` instance and all its managers.

| Method       | Return Type | Description                                                       |
|:-------------|:------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `getGame()`  | `Game`      | Returns the active `Game` instance that is starting.              |
| `getArena()` | `Arena`     | Shortcut to return the `Arena` associated with the starting game. |

## Lifecycle Notes
When this event is called:
* **Player Setup:** Players are already in their designated starting positions.
* **Score Initialization:** The `ScoreRegistry` has been cleared and prepared for the new session.
* **Ready State:** The arena is locked and no longer accepting join attempts.

## Example Usage

This example demonstrates how to trigger a global sound effect or a custom message to the entire server when a game officially starts.

```java
import io.greenmc.santasays.api.event.game.GameStartEvent;
import org.bukkit.Bukkit;
import org.bukkit.Sound;
import org.bukkit.entity.Player;
import org.bukkit.event.EventHandler;
import org.bukkit.event.Listener;

public class GlobalAnnouncementListener implements Listener {

    @EventHandler
    public void onGameStart(GameStartEvent event) {
        String arenaName = event.getArena().getName();

        // Notify the whole server
        Bukkit.broadcastMessage("§6[Santa Says] §eA new game has started in arena: §f" + arenaName);

        // Play a start sound for everyone in the game
        for (Player player : event.getGame().getPlayers()) {
            player.playSound(player.getLocation(), Sound.ENTITY_WITHER_SPAWN, 1.0f, 1.0f);
        }
    }
}
```
