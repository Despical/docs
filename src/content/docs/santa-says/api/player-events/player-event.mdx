title: PlayerEvent
description: The foundation for all player-related events in the Santa Says API.
---

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The `PlayerEvent` class is an abstract base for all events involving a specific player.
It provides developers with a streamlined way to access both the standard Bukkit `Player` object and the internal Santa Says `User` instance.

<Aside type="note">
    Because this is an abstract class, you cannot listen to it directly. Instead, you should listen to its specific subclasses like
    `PlayerJoinAttemptEvent`, `PlayerLeaveGameEvent` or `PlayerStatisticChangeEvent`.

## Methods

| Method        | Return Type | Description                                                                |

| `getPlayer()` | `Player`    | Returns the standard Bukkit `Player` associated with the event.            |
| `getUser()`   | `User`      | Returns the plugin-specific `User` object, containing stats and game data. |

## Known Subclasses
These events inherit all methods from `PlayerEvent`:

* **`PlayerJoinAttemptEvent`**: Fired when a player tries to join an arena.
* **`PlayerLeaveGameEvent`**: Fired when a player exits an active game.
* **`PlayerStatisticChangeEvent`**: Fired when a player's persistent stats (wins, streaks, etc.) are modified.

## Usage in Listeners
When listening to any subclass of `PlayerEvent`, you can immediately access the `User` object to check for statistics or plugin-specific data without manual lookups.

```java
@EventHandler
public void onAnyPlayerEvent(PlayerJoinAttemptEvent event) {
    // Accessing Bukkit Player
    Player bukkitPlayer = event.getPlayer();

    // Accessing Santa Says User
    User user = event.getUser();

    // Example: Check a statistic from the base event
    int totalWins = user.getStatistic(Statistic.WIN);
}
```
