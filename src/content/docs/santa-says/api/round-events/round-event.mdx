title: RoundEvent
description: The foundation for all round-related events in the Santa Says API.
---

The `RoundEvent` class is an abstract base for all events occurring during a specific round of a game. It provides utility methods to track the game progress and identify if the game is reaching its conclusion.

---

## Technical Overview
- **Package:** `io.greenmc.santasays.api.event.round`
- **Parent Class:** `SantaSaysEvent`

### Key Constants
* **LAST_ROUND:** `15` — The game logic currently considers the 15th round as the final stage of a standard match.

## Methods

| Method             | Return Type | Description                                                             |
|:-------------------|:------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `getGame()`        | `Game`      | Returns the `Game` instance associated with this event.                 |
| `getRoundNumber()` | `int`       | Fetches the current round number from the `RoundManager`.               |
| `isLastRound()`    | `boolean`   | Returns `true` if the current round number is equal to the final round. |

---

## Known Subclasses
Since `RoundEvent` is abstract, it is implemented by specific lifecycle events such as:
* **RoundStartEvent**: Fired when a new round begins.
* **RoundEndEvent**: Fired when a round concludes.

---

## Usage in Listeners

When implementing listeners for specific round events (like `RoundStartEvent`), you can use the base methods to trigger special logic when the match is about to end.

```java
@EventHandler
public void onRoundEvent(RoundStartEvent event) {
    // Access the game instance
    Game game = event.getGame();

    // Check if we are at the climax of the game
    if (event.isLastRound()) {
        game.broadcastRawMessage("<red><bold>FINAL ROUND! <gray>Prepare yourselves...");
    } else {
        game.broadcastRawMessage("<yellow>Starting Round #" + event.getRoundNumber());
    }
}
```
