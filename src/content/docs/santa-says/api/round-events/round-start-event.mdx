title: RoundStartEvent
description: Documentation for the event fired when a new round is about to begin in Santa Says.
---

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The `RoundStartEvent` is triggered at the transition point between rounds. It is called after the plugin has selected the next task for the players but **before** that task is officially registered or started.

<Aside type="note">
    The round number returned by this event refers to the round that is currently starting. For example, if Round 4 just finished, this event will return `5`.
</Aside>

## Technical Overview
- **Package:** `io.greenmc.santasays.api.event.round`
- **Parent Class:** [`RoundEvent`](/santa-says/api/round-events/round-event)
- **Cancellable:** No

## Methods

This event inherits all utility methods from the base [`RoundEvent`](/santa-says/api/round-events/round-event) class.

| Method             | Return Type | Description                                             |
|:-------------------|:------------|:--------------------------------------------------------|
| `getGame()`        | `Game`      | Returns the game instance where the round is starting.  |
| `getRoundNumber()` | `int`       | Returns the number of the round that is about to begin. |
| `isLastRound()`    | `boolean`   | Checks if this starting round is the final round.       |

## Lifecycle Timing
Understanding exactly when this event fires is crucial for synchronization:
1. **Previous Round Ends:** The previous task is cleared.
2. **Task Selection:** The plugin picks the next random task.
3. **RoundStartEvent Fired:** This is where this event occurs.
4. **Task Registration:** The selected task starts and objectives are sent to players.

## Example Usage

This example shows how to broadcast a special message at the start of specific rounds or trigger external logic like custom sound effects.

```java
import io.greenmc.santasays.api.event.round.RoundStartEvent;
import org.bukkit.event.EventHandler;
import org.bukkit.event.Listener;

public class RoundTransitionListener implements Listener {

    @EventHandler
    public void onRoundStart(RoundStartEvent event) {
        int roundNumber = event.getRoundNumber();

        // Broadcast a milestone message every 5 rounds
        if (roundNumber % 5 == 0) {
            event.getGame().broadcastRawMessage("<orange><bold>MILESTONE! <yellow>You have reached Round " + roundNumber + "!");
        }

        // Logic for the very last round
        if (event.isLastRound()) {
            event.getGame().rawBroadcastMessage("<red><bold>THE FINAL CHALLENGE BEGINS NOW!");
        }
    }
}
```
