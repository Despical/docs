title: TaskEvent
description: The foundation for all task-related events in the Santa Says API.

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The `TaskEvent` class is an abstract base for all events occurring during the lifecycle of a **Task**. It provides developers with the necessary context to identify which game is active and exactly which task is being executed.

<Aside type="note">
    Since this is an abstract class, you cannot listen to it directly. You should listen to its implementations, such as `TaskStartEvent` or `TaskEndEvent`.
</Aside>

## Technical Overview
- **Package:** `io.greenmc.santasays.api.event.task`
- **Parent Class:** `SantaSaysEvent`

## Methods

| Method      | Return Type | Description                                                      |
|:------------|:------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `getGame()` | `Game`      | Returns the `Game` instance where the task is occurring.         |
| `getTask()` | `Task`      | Returns the specific `Task` instance associated with this event. |

## Known Subclasses
These events inherit all methods from `TaskEvent`:

* **`TaskStartEvent`**: Fired when a task objective is displayed and the timer starts.
* **`TaskEndEvent`**: Fired when the task timer expires or everyone completes the objective.

## Usage in Listeners

When listening to task-related events, you can use the base methods to fetch the name of the task or modify the game environment based on the task type.

```java
import io.greenmc.santasays.api.event.task.TaskStartEvent;
import org.bukkit.event.EventHandler;
import org.bukkit.event.Listener;

public class TaskListener implements Listener {

    @EventHandler
    public void onTaskStart(TaskStartEvent event) {
        // Access data from the base TaskEvent
        String taskName = event.getTask().getName();
        String arenaName = event.getGame().getArena().getName();

        System.out.println("A new task '" + taskName + "' has started in arena: " + arenaName);
    }
}
```
