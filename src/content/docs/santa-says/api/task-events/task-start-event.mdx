title: TaskStartEvent
description: Documentation for the event fired when a specific task is about to start in Santa Says.
---

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The `TaskStartEvent` is fired immediately before a task begins its execution logic. While `RoundStartEvent` signals the beginning of the round transition, this event is focused strictly on the lifecycle of an individual task.

---

## Technical Overview
- **Package:** `io.greenmc.santasays.api.event.task`
- **Parent Class:** [`TaskEvent`](/santa-says/api/task-events/task-event)
- **Cancellable:** No

<Aside type="note">
    This event is called after a task has been selected and registered, but before the internal `Task#start()` method is executed.
</Aside>

## Methods

This event inherits all utility methods from the base [`TaskEvent`](/santa-says/api/task-events/task-event) class.

| Method      | Return Type | Description                                           |
|:------------|:------------|:------------------------------------------------------|
| `getGame()` | `Game`      | Returns the game instance where the task is starting. |
| `getTask()` | `Task`      | Returns the specific task that is about to begin.     |

## Lifecycle Timing
It is important to distinguish this from the round start:
1. **RoundStartEvent:** The system prepares for a new round and selects a task.
2. **Task Registration:** The selected task is initialized.
3. **TaskStartEvent (This event):** The last chance to initialize task-specific state or UI before the timer starts.
4. **Task Start:** The task begins, and players receive their instructions.

## Example Usage

This example demonstrates how to play a specific sound or send a custom action bar message when a task starts.

```java
import io.greenmc.santasays.api.event.task.TaskStartEvent;
import org.bukkit.Sound;
import org.bukkit.entity.Player;
import org.bukkit.event.EventHandler;
import org.bukkit.event.Listener;

public class TaskInitListener implements Listener {

    @EventHandler
    public void onTaskStart(TaskStartEvent event) {
        String taskName = event.getTask().getName();

        // Notify all players in the game that a task is starting
        for (Player player : event.getGame().getPlayers()) {
            player.playSound(player.getLocation(), Sound.BLOCK_NOTE_BLOCK_PLING, 1.0f, 1.0f);
            player.sendActionBar("§fNew Task: §6§l" + taskName);
        }
    }
}
```
