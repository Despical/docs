## First-Run Configuration

After the first restart, a new folder will be created at `/plugins/SantaSays/`. This folder contains everything you need to customize your game:

* `config.yml`: Main plugin settings, storage type selection and general game rules.
* `mysql.yml`: Configure your database credentials if you are using MySQL.
* `items.yml`: Define and customize specific items used in the game.
* `scoreboard.yml`: Fully customizable scoreboard layout and formatting.
* `bossbar.yml`: Configure the style, color, and messages for the in-game boss bar.
* `tasks/`: A directory containing sub-folders for **Participation** and **Placement** tasks.
* `song/`: Place your `.nbs` files here for the in-game radio.
* `messages.yml`: Full control over every string and translation shown to players.

<Aside type="tip">
    Always check your console during the first boot. If there are any missing dependencies or version conflicts, the plugin will alert you there.
