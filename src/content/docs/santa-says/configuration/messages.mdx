description: Customize all in-game messages, titles, subtitles, actionbars and text outputs using MiniMessage.
---

The `messages.yml` file gives you full control over every string of text your players see. From simple chat notifications to complex game titles, everything is fully customizable.

## MiniMessage Support

Santa Says utilizes the **MiniMessage** library, allowing you to create stunning visuals without the limitations of traditional legacy color codes. You can use HEX colors, gradients, and even hover/click events.

* **Gradients:** `<gradient:#ff3b3b:#ffd93b>Your Text Here</gradient>`
* **HEX Colors:** `<color:#55ff55>Solid Color Text</color>`
* **Legacy Tags:** Simple tags like `<red>`, `<b>` (bold), or `<underlined>` are also supported.

---

## Global Placeholders

You can use your defined prefixes in any message to maintain a consistent look across the plugin.

* `%prefix%`: Uses the primary prefix defined in `config.yml`.
* `%prefix-2%`: Uses the secondary prefix defined in `config.yml`.

---

## Configuration Examples

Here is how you can implement these features in your file:

```yaml
# Example of using placeholders and simple color tags
player-joined: '<gray>%player% <yellow>has joined (<aqua>%players%<yellow>/<aqua>%max_players%<yellow>)!'

# Example of a clean, colored notification
new-task-starting: "<green>Game ended! Next game is starting in 3 seconds."
```
