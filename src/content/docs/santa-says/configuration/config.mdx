description: Detailed guide for the main configuration settings of Santa Says.
---

The `config.yml` file is the heart of Santa Says. It controls the game lifecycle, database management, and essential gameplay mechanics.

---

## General Settings

* **`prefix` & `prefix-2`**: Sets the visual identity of the plugin in chat. Supports MiniMessage, gradients, and HEX colors.
* **`database`**: Defines how player statistics and profiles are stored.
  * `flat`: Local storage using YAML files (**standard for small servers**).
  * `mysql`: External database storage (**recommended for large networks**).

**Note:** Changing the database type requires a server restart and does not support automatic data migration.

## Time Settings

These values (in seconds) control the pace of your game. Santa Says features a "Smart Timer" system that accelerates the start as more players join.

| Option | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `waiting-time` | 300 | The idle timer when the minimum player count hasn't been reached. |
| `pre-game-waiting-time` | 120 | The countdown that starts once the arena has enough players. |
| `game-starting-time` | 30 | If the arena hits **80% capacity**, the timer automatically drops to this value. |
| `full-game-starting-time` | 15 | If the arena is **100% full**, the timer drops to this value for an instant start. |
| `ending-time` | 10 | Duration players stay in the arena to celebrate after the match ends. |

## Gameplay Mechanics

* **`level-bar-timer`**: When enabled, the XP bar of players will visually reflect the remaining time during the waiting and starting phases.
* **`instant-leave`**:
  * `true`: Players leave immediately upon right-clicking the leave item.
  * `false`: Adds a 3-second delay to prevent accidental exits.
* **`separate-chat`**: When active, it creates a "chat bubble" around the game. Players inside only hear each other, and global chat is hidden from them to prevent distractions.

---

## System & Performance

* **`tick-period`**: Controls the internal update frequency of the arena logic. The default (5) is optimized for performance. Lowering it makes timers more precise but increases CPU usage.
* **`debug`**: Set to `true` to access advanced administrative and troubleshooting commands.
* **`event-profiling`**: An advanced diagnostic tool.
  * `enabled`: Measures how long event listeners take to process.
  * `verbose`: Logs every single execution to the console (use only for deep debugging).
