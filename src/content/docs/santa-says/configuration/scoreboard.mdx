description: Detailed guide for configuring the dynamic, state-based scoreboard.
---

The `scoreboard.yml` file allows you to customize the information displayed on the right side of the screen. The scoreboard is **state-aware**, switching its logic and available placeholders automatically as the game progresses.

---

## Global Placeholders

These placeholders are available in **every stage** of the game (Waiting, Starting, In-Game, and Ending).

| Placeholder         | Description                                       |
|:--------------------|:--------------------------------------------------|
| `%player%`          | The name of the player viewing the scoreboard.    |
| `%date%`            | The current date (formatted automatically).       |
| `%timer%`           | Remaining time in seconds (e.g., `30`).           |
| `%formatted_timer%` | Remaining time in `MM:SS` format (e.g., `00:30`). |
| `%players%`         | Current number of players in the arena.           |
| `%min_players%`     | The minimum players required to start.            |
| `%max_players%`     | The maximum capacity of the arena.                |

## State-Specific Placeholders
---

### 1. Waiting & Starting Phases
These focus on the countdown and player requirements.

* **`%players_needed%`**: How many more players must join to reach the `min_players` threshold.
* **`%s%`**: Returns an "s" if `players_needed` is greater than 1, and an empty string if it's 1. Perfect for grammar: `Waiting for %players_needed% player%s%`.

### 2. In-Game & Ending Phases
These focus on the live leaderboard and player progress.

* **`%round%`**: The current round number (out of 15).
* **`%score%`**: The current player's personal score.
* **`%player_1%`, `%player_2%`, `%player_3%`**: Names of the top 3 players. Defaults to "No Player" if the slot is empty.
* **`%player_1_score%`, `%player_2_score%`, `%player_3_score%`**: Scores of the top 3 players. Defaults to "0" if empty.

## The Conditional Prefix

This is a special functional placeholder used for clean UI design.

If a line starts with `%if_not_in_top3%`, the plugin checks the player's current rank:
1. **If the player IS in the Top 3:** The entire line is hidden.
2. **If the player IS NOT in the Top 3:** The prefix is removed, and the rest of the line is displayed.

### Example Usage
```yaml
- "%player_1%: %player_1_score%"
- "%player_2%: %player_2_score%"
- "%player_3%: %player_3_score%"
- "%if_not_in_top3%<white>..."
- "%if_not_in_top3%<gray>Your Score: %score%"
```
