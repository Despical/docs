title: items.yml
description: Comprehensive guide for customizing in-game items and lobby tools.
---

The `items.yml` file allows you to define the visual and functional properties of items used within the plugin, such as the lobby leave tool or special game-specific items.

---

## Basic Item Structure

Every item in the configuration follows a standard format. Here is an example of the default lobby leave item:

```yaml
lobby-items:
  leave-item:
    material: RED_BED
    slot: 8
    name: "<red><bold>Return to Lobby <gray>(Right Click)"
    lore:
      - "<gray>Right-click to leave to the lobby!"
    glow: true
    unbreakable: true
```

## Supported Properties

You can use the following keys to further customize your items:

| Key | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `material` | The material name for the item. | `DIAMOND_SWORD` |
| `amount` | The quantity of the item in the stack. | `1` |
| `name` | The display name of the item. | `<gold>Santa's Blade` |
| `lore` | A list of lines for the item's description. | `- "<gray>Line 1"` |
| `glow` | If true, adds an enchantment glow without visible enchants. | `true` |
| `enchants` | A list of enchantments and levels. | `SHARPNESS:5` |
| `itemFlags` | Hides certain item attributes (e.g., attributes, enchants). | `HIDE_ENCHANTS` |
| `unbreakable` | Prevents the item from losing durability. | `true` |
| `durability` | Sets the remaining durability of the item. | `100` |
| `hideTooltip` | Hides the default Minecraft tooltip for the item. | `true` |
| `data` | Used for specific legacy data values. | `1` |

## Oraxen Support

Santa Says features native integration with **Oraxen**, allowing you to use high-quality custom textures and 3D models for your game items.

To use an Oraxen item, instead of defining a standard `material`, use the `oraxen:` prefix followed by the item ID defined in your configuration.

### Example Configuration
```yaml
custom-game-item:
  material: "oraxen:flame_sword"
  name: "<gradient:orange:red>Flame Sword</gradient>"
  glow: true
```
