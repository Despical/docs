title: bossbar.yml
description: Customize the appearance and behavior of the boss bar throughout different game stages.
---

The `bossbar.yml` file allows you to manage the visual top-bar that players see during the game. You can use it to display server branding, game status, or simply keep it clean and minimal.

---

## Global Toggle

* **`enabled`**: Set this to `false` if you want to completely disable the BossBar system across all game stages.

---

## Game States & Appearance

The boss bar is dynamic and changes based on the current state of the arena. You can customize the **title**, **overlay (style)**, and **color** for each state.

| State | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `waiting` | When players are in the lobby waiting for the minimum requirement. |
| `starting` | During the final countdown before the match begins. |
| `in-game` | While the tasks are actively being performed. |
| `ending` | After a winner is declared and before players are sent back to the lobby. |

:::tip
**The Invisible Trick:** If you set the `title` to an empty string (`""`) for any state, the BossBar will become **invisible** during that specific phase. This is perfect if you want a clean screen during active gameplay (`in-game`) but want branding in the lobby.
