description: Configuration for the interactive arena setup GUI used by administrators.
---

The `setup-menu.yml` file defines the appearance and feedback messages of the interactive GUI opened via `/santasays edit <arena>`. This menu guides administrators through the process of setting up locations, player limits, and game platforms.

---

## Setup Categories
---

### 1. Location Settings
These items allow you to define the critical teleport points for your arena.

| Item Key | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `lobby` | Sets the waiting area where players spawn before the game starts. |
| `start` | Sets the location where players are teleported when the match begins. |
| `end` | Sets the celebration/spectator area for the end of the game. |

### 2. Player Amounts
Configures the capacity of the arena.
* **`min-player-amount`**: The threshold to start the game countdown.
* **`max-player-amount`**: The hard limit of players allowed in the arena.
* **Click Logic:** Usually configured so that **Left Click** increases and **Right Click** decreases the value within the GUI.

### 3. The Platform Selector
The `platform-selector` is the most advanced tool in the setup menu. It defines the physical area where tasks take place.

**Administrator Controls (Blaze Rod Tool):**
* **Left Click:** Select **Position 1** (or add to area).
* **Right Click:** Select **Position 2** (or remove from area).
* **Sneak + Left Click:** Remove a single specific block from the platform.
* **Sneak + Right Click:** Add a single specific block to the platform.
