title: stats-menu.yml
description: Customize the look and feel of the player statistics and ranking interface.
---

The `stats-menu.yml` file controls the visual layout of the statistics GUI. This is where players can track their wins, losses, streaks, and overall performance in the workshop.

---

### Menu Basics

* **`rows`**: Defines the height of the GUI (1-6). A value of `6` creates a full-sized chest menu.
* **`title`**: The name displayed at the top of the menu. Supports **MiniMessage** for gradients and bold text.

---

### Item Configuration

Each item in the statistics menu can be fully customized with materials, slots, and unique properties.

| Property | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `slots` | A single number `slot: 13` or a list `slots: [0, 1, 2]` for bulk placement. |
| `material` | The item to display (Supports **Oraxen** via `oraxen:id`). |
| `decoration-only` | If `true`, the item is purely visual and cannot be interacted with. |
| `skull` | Used for `PLAYER_HEAD` materials. Set to `%target%` to show the player's own skin. |
| `glow` | If `true`, adds an enchantment glint to the item. |
| `itemFlags` | Used to clean up the item's look (e.g., `HIDE_ATTRIBUTES`). |

### Statistics Placeholders

These placeholders are used within the `name` or `lore` of items to display live data:

* **`%target%`**: The name of the player whose profile is being viewed.
* **`%wins%`**: Total number of games won.
* **`%losses%`**: Total number of games lost.
* **`%win_streak%`**: Current consecutive wins.
* **`%win_streak_record%`**: The highest win streak ever achieved by the player.
* **`%score_record%`**: The highest points collected in a single game.
* **`%games_played%`**: Total number of matches joined.
* **`%rounds_played%`**: Total number of individual tasks/rounds completed.
