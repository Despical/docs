Player Commands are available to **regular players** and do not require administrative permissions. These commands allow players to interact with Santa Says gameplay by joining arenas, leaving matches, and viewing statistics.

All commands can be used via `/santasays` or its alias `/ss`.

### Join Command

Allows a player to join a Santa Says arena. The plugin automatically checks arena availability, game state, and capacity before allowing the player to join.

```bash
/santasays join <arena>
```

### Leave Command

Safely removes the player from the current Santa Says game. This command can be used at any time during gameplay and will return the player to the lobby location.

```bash
/santasays leave
```

### Stats Command

Displays detailed Santa Says statistics through an in-game menu.

By default, the command opens your own statistics, including completed games, placements, and overall performance.
When a player name is provided, the same statistics are shown for the specified player.
Statistics can be viewed for both online and offline players.

```bash
/santasays stats [player]
```
