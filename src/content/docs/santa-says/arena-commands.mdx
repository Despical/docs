Arena management commands allow administrators to build and maintain the game environments. These commands are essential for the initial setup and ongoing management of your Santa Says maps.

### Create Command

Administrators with the `santasays.arena.create` permission can register a new arena instance. This command initializes a unique ID for the arena, which will be used for all subsequent configurations.

```bash
/santasays create <arena_id>
```

### Delete Command

Administrators with the `santasays.arena.delete` permission can permanently remove an arena instance. This action unregisters the arena and its associated game instance.

```bash
/santasays delete <arena_id>
```

### List Command

Administrators with the `santasays.arena.list` permission can display a complete list of all registered arena IDs. This is useful for checking active arenas and verifying their names for other commands.

```bash
/santasays list
```

### Edit Command

Administrators with the `santasays.arena.edit` permission can open the interactive **Setup Menu** for a specific arena. This command is only accessible to players as it opens a GUI to visually configure spawns, boundaries, and other essential arena settings.

```bash
/santasays edit <arena_id>
```
