## Scoring System

Understanding how to earn points is the key to victory. Not all tasks are created equal; the game dynamically switches between two scoring modes to keep players on their toes.

### 1. Participation Tasks
These tasks focus on survival and completion. They are designed to keep the lobby engaged.

* **Objective:** Successfully complete the instruction within the time limit.
* **Reward:** **+1 Point** for *everyone* who succeeds.
* **Strategy:** Focus on accuracy. As long as you finish, you get the point.

### 2. Placement Tasks
These are high-stakes rounds where speed is everything. Only the fastest players are rewarded, creating intense "clutch" moments.

* **Objective:** Be among the first 3 players to complete the objective (or perform the most actions, e.g., breaking the most snow).
* **Reward:**
  * 🥇 **1st Place:** +3 Points
  * 🥈 **2nd Place:** +2 Points
  * 🥉 **3rd Place:** +1 Point
* **Strategy:** Risk it all for speed. Being 4th place gets you **0 points**.

<Aside type="tip">
    **Pro Tip:** Pay close attention to the task type in the chat or boss bar. Recognizing a "Placement" task early is often the difference between winning and losing the match.

## Winning the Game

After the 15th round concludes, the game calculates the final standings.
The player with the highest total score is crowned the winner. In the event of a tie, the game logic handles the ranking based on internal tie-breaker rules (usually based on who reached the score first or total completion time).

<Aside type="note">
    Server administrators can customize the total number of rounds, task duration, and specific task pools in the `config.yml` to tailor the experience for their community.
