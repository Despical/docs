## Santa Says 🎅

**Santa Says** is a fast-paced Minecraft minigame built around quick challenges, competitive scoring, and round-based gameplay.
Players must complete a series of short tasks under time pressure, earning points through participation and top placements.
After 15 intense rounds, the player with the highest score wins the game.

Designed for fast matches, high replayability, and competitive servers, Santa Says is easy to learn but hard to master.
