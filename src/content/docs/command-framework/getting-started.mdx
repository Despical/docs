description: Lightweight, annotation-based command framework for Minecraft plugins.
---

**Command Framework** is a lightweight, annotation-based command system designed to simplify command handling in your Minecraft plugins. It works similarly to Bukkit's event system, eliminating the need to add commands to your `plugin.yml` while still allowing you to configure essential command features directly in your code.

## Key Features

- **No plugin.yml:** Effortlessly manage commands directly through annotations, eliminating the need to modify your `plugin.yml` file.
- **Configurable Options:** Customize every aspect of your commands right in the code. Easily set command usage, descriptions, permissions, aliases, sender types, cooldowns, and argument limits.
- **Custom Parameters:** Speed up your development by creating and adding custom parameters. Make command inputs fit your needs easily, without complicated setups.
- **Cooldown Management:** Implement advanced cooldowns to control how frequently commands can be executed.
- **Confirmation System:** Require players to confirm critical commands before execution to prevent accidental actions.
- **Arguments as Options:** Use options formatted as `--option=value` for more intuitive command usage.
- **Arguments as Flags:** Implement simple flags with the `--flag` format for quick command modifications.
